# Task 1

# Movie Genre Classification

## About

Movie Genre Classification is a machine learning project that predicts the genre of a movie based on its plot summary or other textual information. This project leverages natural language processing techniques and deep learning models to classify movies into various genres.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python (>=3.6)
- TensorFlow
- scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook (for training and experimenting)

You can install the required Python libraries using the following command:

pip install tensorflow scikit-learn jupyter
### Installation

1.  Clone this repository to your local machine:

`git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/Movie-Genre-Classification.git
cd Movie-Genre-Classification` 

2.  Download the dataset and place it in the appropriate folder.
	The movie genre classification dataset used in this project is 	sourced from Kaggle. It includes a diverse collection of movie plot summaries and their corresponding genres.
-  **Dataset Source**: [Kaggle - Movie Genre Classification Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hijest/genre-classification-dataset-imdb)
-  **Description**: This dataset contains movie plot summaries from various genres, making it suitable for training and evaluating the genre classification model.
    
3.  Train the model using Jupyter Notebook.
    
## Usage

To use the Movie Genre Classification model, follow these steps:

1.  Ensure you have installed the necessary dependencies and have trained the model.

2.  After that save the model into a "H5" format.
-  `# Assuming 'model' is your trained model:`
-    model.save('your_model.h5')
    
4.  Load the model and integrate it into gradio or streamlit or whichever UI Library you prefer.
- `You can load the model using the following:`
- model = tf.keras.models.load_model('your_model.h5')

5.  The predicted genre(s) will be displayed on the web interface or UI.
    

## Features

-   Predicts multiple genres for a given movie plot summary.
-   Easily customizable to include additional features or improve model accuracy.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:

-   [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/install) installed.
-   Python 3.x and required libraries installed.
-  You can install the required libraries by using:
	`pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn sklearn nltk pickle gradio`
### Data
The dataset used for this project can be found at [SMS Spam Collection Dataset | Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/sms-spam-collection-dataset?resource=download). The SMS Spam Collection is a set of SMS tagged messages that have been collected for SMS Spam research. It contains one set of SMS messages in English of 5,574 messages, tagged acording being ham (legitimate) or spam.
### Usage

1.  Clone this repository:
    
    `git clone https://github.com/your-username/Spam-SMS-Detector.git` 
    
2.  Open the `Spam SMS Detector.ipynb` Jupyter Notebook file.
    
3.  Follow the instructions and run the code cells to explore the project, including data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
    
4.  Experiment with the classifiers, adjust parameters, and fine-tune the models as needed.
